The code for my Final-Year Data Science Project

### Experiment Notebook
The file named "Experiment" will read from the files "chicago_data_frame.csv" and "reviews_file_chicago.txt". The script will execute the experiment comparing the Mean Review helpfulness and the three different recommendation methods (Classification, Date and Random). Similarly, it will execute the experiment to get the results of the percentage of helpful reviews recommended by the recommender for each recommender. The results of the tests are printed as standard output in the notebook. 

Downloading the notebook and the files "Chicago_data_frame.csv", "reviews_file_chicago.txt" will allow you to run this without doing anything else. You will get the results from running this alone.


### Data Preprocessing Notebook

This notebook reads the "chicago.txt" file. The "chicago.txt" file was the original dataset I was given for this project. The script will read this file and parse the data into a data frame. The data frame is then written to the file "chicago_data_frame.csv".
